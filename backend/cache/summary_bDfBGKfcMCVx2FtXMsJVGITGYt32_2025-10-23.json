It also provided 2.7g of dietary fiber, along with some calcium (162mg) and iron (4.86mg). Your \"manchuria\" meal added 300 calories, with a more substantial 22.5g protein, 30g carbohydrates, and 10g fat.\n\nWhile your overall calorie intake was moderate, there are clear opportunities to enhance your nutritional balance. Your total protein intake was quite low for the day, which is essential for muscle maintenance and satiety. The \"Panner rice\" meal was notably high in sugars and fats, and your overall fiber intake was minimal.\n\nTo improve your nutritional profile, consider incorporating more lean protein sources like chicken, fish, or legumes into your meals. Boosting your intake of fiber-rich vegetables, fruits, and whole grains would also be beneficial for digestive health and sustained energy. Being mindful of added sugars and unhealthy fats, opting for whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible, will help you achieve a more balanced and nutrient-dense diet.",
